# Pewlett-Hackard Employee Analysis Module Challenge

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)


Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results:

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.  Use images as support where needed. (6 pt)

## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
