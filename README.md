# Pewlett-Hackard Employee Analysis Module Challenge

## Overview of the analysis:
After building an employee database for Pewlett Hackard and using it to identify those employees that are approaching retirement, we were given two new assignments. The first is to determine the number of retiring employees per title to give management an idea of what levels in the organizational hierarchy will be affected. while the second is to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This report represents the results and analysis of that assignment.

## Results:

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.  Use images as support where needed. (6 pt)

## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)

- Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
2. 
3. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
